# Fitness Tracker READme


## Description
This application is designed to aid users in tracking data they are able to input to the tracker as well as view data and statistics for the workouts. Users are able to view, create, and track daily workouts with the ability to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. A workout is able to contain pertinent data such as the name of the exercises, types of exercises, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, distance traveled may be logged as well.
